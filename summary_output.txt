I remember loving Smallville. I thought I'd live there forever. But my father's death set me on a different path. I moved to Metropolis to become who I was meant to be. My most vivid memory of all is the day I met Lois Hannigan. The heat exchanger's offline. We need water back in the reactor vessel. We're going to have a meltdown the size of Fukushima. I'm actually starting QB. I think I'm the first freshman to ever do it. I'll talk to Lois about some dates. R Raiden meets Eliza for the first time since returning home from the hospital. He tells her he's sorry he missed therapy because he was in Wichita for a story. He says he's nervous about starting high school, but it's okay if you're nervous. "Life's a little different in Smallville," he says. phthalmologist: "I'm just saying. They're 14, they're 14. They don't need to know yet" "It's too dangerous for them to know. ... The whole world knows who I am" "I lived on a farm. I had powers" "You're worried about Jordan. He was pretty upset last night" Lois's son Branden returns home from the hospital with his wife, Lana, and their two daughters. The family is reunited with Dr. Frye and his son, Clark, who had suffered a stroke. Clark's mother, Lois, is worried about her son's health. Lois tells Clark that Foswell's no editor. I didn't think you guys would have REMembered me from that summer. I'm really sorry about your grandma. She was really special. Even my dad liked her, but he hates everyone, so... house full of girls. I think there's something wrong with the router. Lana: Morgan Edge ruins everything he touches. Kyle: "He is singlehandedly destroying the Daily Planet" Lana: "I don't understand how he can keep fooling people" Kent: "It's good thing we don't have to worry about that anymore now, do we?" phthalmologist: "I shouldn't have lost my cool with Kyle. I'm sorry for your loss" "There's a bonfire tomorrow at the old Shuster Mine. Hit me up if you want to go, but I can't guarantee I won't get you into trouble" "You're both really lucky. All we have are mild concussions?" "Yes, that's right. We're fine" Lois: "I can't lose him, Lois. I can't. He's pulled so far away from me already" Jon: "There's something a lot freakier than me that happened to us in that barn" Lois: "It's Kryptonian. You are Kryptonian" Lois: "There is a powerful something out there that doesn't like Superman or nuclear power plants" Clark: "Whoever did this knows who I am. He's studying you, Clark" Lois: "The world will always need Superman. But right now, this family needs you more" Martha was like this town's Superman or Superwoman. She still protected half the farm's value. She wanted there to be enough money                to send the boys to college. Jon: "I don't think she wanted you to sell it. I think she wants you to save it" I'm half human, half whatever the hell he is, Jordan says. "I was sent here when my planet, Krypton, was destroyed," Superman says. Jordan's parents put him on pills to control his powers. "They raised me. They taught me how to control my abilities," he says. phthalmologist: 'I don't really know how you guys party in Metropolis, but here in Smallville, we do it a little different' 'I know you're here. I know you can't see me. I'm just glad that you made it. You promised me trouble' 'It feels like it's my fault that this is all falling apart' ophobic: "I took a bunch of my mom's pills a year ago, and I still don't understand why I did it" "I saw you take one back at the funeral reception," he says. "You're the only person I know around here who's on something, so... so... you're not the only one on something," he adds. "It's not that big of a deal," she says. Superman returns home to his family. His father asks him to apologize to his brother. Clark says he's okay, but Jordan's powers are manifesting very differently than his own. Clark asks his father to check the bank for any unusual activity in the last five or six years. Clark Kent's mom wanted him to move back to Smallville. He says she knew how busy he was in Metropolis and how absent he'd been. Clark and his family are thinking of reopening the farm. Clark: "These are the important years, Clark" I should have neverkissed you last night, says Morgan Edge. "I just wanted to hang out with you," Sarah says. "It's not your fault," Morgan responds. "You didn't know about Sean, either," Sarah adds. "That is awkward. Good luck" phthalmologist: "We need to improve tactile function and speed if I'm gonna end this. We also need kryptonite. That was the last of your supply. I'll start the upgrades to your armor right away, Captain Luthor"
