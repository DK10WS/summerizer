to produce alternative energies.

he was a father.

785
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,593
I didn't know it back then,

786
00:57:10,178 --> 00:57:12,013
but he had no idea what he was doing.

787
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:21,272
That didn't matter

788
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:25,777
'cause he was always there.

789
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:32,366
You were right.

790
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:36,537
I haven't always been there for you.

791
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,999
But I promise you, from now on,

792
00:57:41,209 --> 00:57:42,209
I will be.

793
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:03,773
[LANA] I pulled some strings.
Got you $2,100 an acre,

794
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:06,234
which is well above market value
in Rice County.

795
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,903
Wow, that... That's very generous.

796
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:10,446
Um...

797
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:13,324
But we decided we're...
We're not selling.

798
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,200
You're not?

799
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:17,996
We're thinking of reopening the farm,

800
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:20,999
and run it the way my folks and I
used to back in the day.

801
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,042
So, you're staying?

802
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:27,171
Well, we're talking it over, but
a change might be good for this family.

803
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:31,259
Okay.

804
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:35,304
Then, let's go over
the pre-negotiated terms

805
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:36,931
for taking on the loan.

806
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:38,349
Before we do, Lana,

807
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:41,602
I was wondering if you knew
that a couple months before

808
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:43,271
those reverse mortgages were offered,

809
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:45,565
a company had secretly
acquired your bank.

810
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,900
No, I didn't know that.

811
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:51,446
Galaxy Holdings, whose majority
shareholder is Morgan Edge.

812
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,241
Why would someone like Morgan Edge

813
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:58,870
be interested in a bunch
of family farms in Smallville, Kansas?

814
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:01,914
That's a very good question.

815
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,423
How's everyone doing after last night?

816
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:12,467
Tag Harris broke his arm.

817
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:16,429
Other than that, nobody else got hurt.

818
00:59:17,305 --> 00:59:18,973
Anyone say what caused the explosion?

819
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,894
My dad said it was probably
just a methane pocket.

820
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:32,862
Look, I should have never
kissed you last night.

821
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:36,949
Wow. That is awkward. Good luck.

822
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:39,827
It's not your fault.

823
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:41,829
You didn't know about Sean,

824
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:45,124
and I'm just really sorry
about how it all went down.

825
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:48,669
I just wanted to hang out with you.

826
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:51,506
You were so sweet that summer
that we met.

827
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:53,989
And then, yeah, I saw you
take the pill at the funeral and...

828
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:59,680
I just thought that
if someone like you had issues,

829
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:02,767
then someone like me wasn't
so messed up.

830
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:05,895
I think maybe it means
we're both just a little messed up.

831
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:10,274
Yeah, maybe you're right.

832
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,500
Do you think that
you can keep it a secret?

833
01:00:16,531 --> 01:00:19,117
Well, one person finds out,
and then everybody knows,

834
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,960
- and then just...
- Yeah. Yeah, you don't...

835
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:22,870
Your secret's safe with me.

836
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:25,915
- Thanks.
- Sarah!

837
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:31,629
- I'm sorry.
- It's... It's all right.

838
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:36,801
- See you around?
- Yeah.

839
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:52,108
Well, that didn't look
like a total disaster.

840
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,651
- Am I right?
- Yeah. Look...

841
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:56,737
Jon, about the powers.

842
01:00:58,823 --> 01:00:59,823
It's all good.

843
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:02,033
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

844
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:03,828
Powers are overrated anyways.

845
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:06,164
Plus, this just

846
01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:09,333
confirms what I've known
to be true all along.

847
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,417
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

848
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:12,503
My skills on the field are legit.

849
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,130
Come on.

850
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,359
I still cannot believe
you just said that to her.

851
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:36,736
You know, when you first...

852
01:01:39,572 --> 01:01:40,572
Hey, boys?

853
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:43,969
What would you guys think about
staying here a little longer

854
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:45,912
than any of us planned?

855
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:47,371
Like a couple days or something?

856
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:52,126
More like permanently?

857
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:56,839
I mean, I have school,
practice with the team...

858
01:01:56,923 --> 01:01:58,883
We know. We know.
It's a big conversation.

859
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:00,527
Yeah, we'll have it tonight
at family dinner.

860
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,095
We just wanted to give you both
some time to process

861
01:02:03,221 --> 01:02:06,098
what this would really be like
before we do.

862
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:08,433
Okay.

863
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:10,775
Until then, you two,
follow me out to the barn.

864
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,011
I wanna show you a few things.

865
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,649
Like, Superman things?

866
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:16,525
Like, how to attach a plow to a tractor.

867
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:17,900
- What?
- Seriously?

868
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:19,504
Those fields aren't
gonna plough themselves.

869
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,113
Okay, but, Dad, we have questions.

870
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:23,217
- We just found out our dad's Superman.
- I got, like,

871
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:25,701
thousands and thousands of questions...

872
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,443
We need to improve tactile function
and speed if I'm gonna end this.

873
01:02:59,694 --> 01:03:02,905
[FEMALE VOICE] <i>We also need kryptonite.
That was the last of your supply.</i>

874
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:04,927
[MAN] Then we'll have to go get some.

875
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,744
<i>I'll start the upgrades
to your armor right away,</i>

876
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,746
<i>Captain Luthor.</i>
